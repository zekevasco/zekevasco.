The best gaming mouse won't mess up your headshots, or your wallet. Whether your bag is fast-paced FPS games, precise strategy, or the timeless timed puzzle, you need a mouse that matches your gaming style. The best mice deliver sturdy, accurate clicks at a price that suits you, and a wireless gaming mouse should have a good long battery life.

If you prefer a controller for PC gaming(opens in new tab), we understand. You're good cruising through life on analogue in your favourite driving game, or RPG, but a great gaming mouse will be specialised toward certain genres you might otherwise be interested in. The best mouse for FPS games will provide the speed and accuracy you need, and the best lightweight mouse(opens in new tab) will be easy to fling around for a 360° no-scope. The best mouse for MOBA will include a wealth of buttons for all your bindings, and is likely to be weightier, too. Whatever you play, it's always good to have a great gaming mouse as a backup for when controller stick drift(opens in new tab) sets in.

Today, the best wireless mice(opens in new tab) are just as accurate as their wired counterparts, so these are certainly worth considering if you want to go untethered. Whether you prefer them wired or wireless, light or heavy, or laden with programmable buttons, there's 100% a mouse perfect for you out there. 

The best gaming mouse doesn't have to cost a bunch either; I've found some great budget gaming mice, and I've personally tested dozens of gaming mice over the years. As a team we've boiled them down to bring you the best gaming mice that are actually worth your time. If you're looking to round off your setup, the best gaming keyboards(opens in new tab) will pair nicely with the mice below. Otherwise, you'll be performing a bit lopsidedly.
